## Project 1 - Characters, Spirals and Hidden Unit Dynamics (hw1)
https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9444/20T3/hw1/index.html

Part 1: Japanese Character Recognition
I will be implementing networks to recognize handwritten Hiragana symbols. The dataset used is Kuzushiji-MNIST or KMNIST for short.
Implementing a linear network, a fully connected two layer network and a convolutional network to classify handwritten digits. We will work with the MNIST dataset, a common dataset used to evaluate Machine Learning models. 

Part 2: Twin Spirals Task
Part incorporates training on the famous Two Spirals Problem (Lang and Witbrock, 1988). I'll be using the provided code of PolarNet and RawNet initially.
Then modifying the parameters, adding new layers, experimenting with optimizers to find the best results.

Part 3: Hidden Unit Dynamics
Part 3 involves investigating hidden unit dynamics, using the supplied code in encoder_main.py, encoder_model.py as well as encoder.py.
It also includes creating my own training data in tensors target1 and target2, which will generate two images of a new design of my choosing.


## Project 2 - Rating and Category Prediction
https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9444/20T3/hw2/

Project 2 consists of writing a Pytorch program that learns to read business reviews in text format and predict a rating (positive or negative) associated with each review, as well as a business category (0=Restaurants, 1=Shopping, 2=Home Services, 3=Health & Medical, 4=Automotive).

## Marks:
Project 1 - 30/30

Project 2 - 27/30
